Zeckendorf's theorem:
Every positive integer can be written in 
	a unique way as a sum of one or more 
	distinct Fibonacci numbers such that 
	the sum does not include any two 
	consecutive Fibonacci numbers. 
	For any given positive integer, a 
	representation that satisfies 
	Zeckendorf’s theorem can be found by 
	using a Greedy algorithm: 
	Choose the largest possible 
	Fibonacci number at each step. 
	For example: 100 = 89 + 8 + 3; 
				77 = 55 + 21 + 1, 
				18 = 13 + 5, etc.

Pisano Period: where the 
	last one/ last two/ last three/ last four digit(s) 
	of a Fibonacci number repeats with a period of 
	60/ 300/ 1500/ 15000, respectively.
