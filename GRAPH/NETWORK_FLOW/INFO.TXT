MAX_FLOW_GOMORYHU
	* find min cut between every pair of vertices 
		using N max_flow call (instead of N^2)
	* not tested with directed graph
	* index from 0

MAX_FLOW_MINCUT
	* Minimum cut between every pair 
		of vertices (Stoer Wagner)

MAX_FLOW_FASTEST
	* fastest flow
	* does not work with directed graph
	* index from 0, directed
	* can get trace

MAX_FLOW_BASIC
	* basic flow
	* can work with directed graph
	* index from 0, directed
	* can get trace
	
MIN_COST_BASIC
	* basic slow version (Ford Bellman)
	* can work with negative edges but not loop
	* index from 0, directed
	* can get trace but very dangerous
	
MIN_COST_DIJKSTRA
	* fast min cost max flow (Dijkstra)
	* can NOT work with negative edges
	* index from 0, directed
	* can get trace but very dangerous
	
MIN_COST_SPFA
	* min cost max flow
	* can work with negative edges but not loop
	* index from 0, directed
	* edges cap changed during find flow
